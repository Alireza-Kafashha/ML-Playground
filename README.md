# **Credit Card Fraud Detection**

## **Overview**
This project was developed for the **Rayan International AI Contest** and focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in credit card datasets using machine learning techniques.

Fraud detection is a critical application of machine learning, aimed at identifying suspicious transactions in large datasets. This repository demonstrates the end-to-end process of developing a fraud detection model, including data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

---

## **Features**
- Load and preprocess datasets from Kaggle.
- Implement fraud detection models using **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.
- Evaluate model performance using various metrics.
- Visualize insights with libraries like `scikit-plot`.

---

## **Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mojtabanafez/rayan-homework1/data). Please download the dataset and place it in the repository directory before running the notebook.

---

## **Installation**
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Requirements**:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scikit-plot`

---

## **Usage**
1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection
   ```

2. Download the dataset from the Kaggle link and extract it into the repository folder.

3. Open and run the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ML-Playground.ipynb
   ```
